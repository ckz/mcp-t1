The five-story palace is constructed of red and pink sandstone and features a distinctive honeycomb facade with 953 small windows called jharokhas. These windows were designed to allow royal ladies to observe street festivals while remaining unseen, as they had to obey strict "purdah" (face covering). The palace's unique architecture also creates a cooling effect through ventilation, giving it its name.</p>
