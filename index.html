                        <p>The Amazon Rainforest, largely contained within Brazil, is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering over 5.5 million square kilometers. Often called the "Lungs of the Earth," it produces about 20% of the world's oxygen and houses the greatest biodiversity on the planet with millions of species of plants, animals, and insects—many still undiscovered. The Amazon River, running through the forest, is the world's largest river by discharge volume. This ecosystem is crucial for global climate regulation and is home to numerous indigenous communities with rich cultural traditions.</p>
