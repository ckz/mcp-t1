    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated three examples of using the Web Content MCP server with AutoGen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Example**: Fetching and rewriting web content\n",
    "2. **UI Console Example**: Adding a UI to visualize the conversation between agents\n",
    "3. **File Writing Example**: Extending the workflow to save the rewritten content to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples showcase how MCP servers can be used to extend the capabilities of AutoGen agents, allowing them to interact with external systems like web content and the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCP Servers**: Provide tools that agents can use to interact with external systems\n",
    "- **AutoGen Agents**: Specialized AI assistants that can use tools and communicate with each other\n",
    "- **Round-Robin Teams**: A way to organize agents to take turns processing a task\n",
    "- **Termination Conditions**: Rules that determine when a conversation should end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend these examples by:\n",
    "- Adding more agents to the workflow\n",
    "- Implementing different conversation patterns\n",
    "- Creating custom MCP servers for other external systems\n",
    "- Building a web UI for the workflow"
